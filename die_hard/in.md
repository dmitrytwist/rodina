You don't like flyin', do you?

What gives you that idea?

You wanna know the secret to surviving air travel?

After you get where you're going, take off your shoes and your socks.
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes.

Fists with your toes?

I know, I know. It sounds crazy.
Trust me. I've been doin' it for nine years.

Yes, sir. Better than a shower and a hot cup of coffee.

Okay.

It's okay. I'm a cop.
Trust me. I've been doin' this for 11 years.

*voices in background*
On behalf of your captain and crew...
we'd like to welcome you to Los Angeles.
Have a very Merry Christmas.
Flight 247 to Tucson now boarding at Gate 14.

Mr. Edward Machowski, please report to the white courtesy phone.

Ah.

How do you do?

Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen!

I want to congratulate each and every one of you... 
for making this one of the greatest years in the history of the Nakatomi Corporation.

On behalf of the chief executive officer, Mr. Ozu, and the board of directors...
we thank you, one and all, and wish you a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!

Hey, Holly, what about dinner tonight, huh?

Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

Families, stockings.

Chestnuts.

Rudolph and Frosty.

Any of these things ring a bell?

Actually, I was thinkin' more of mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...
and a roaring fireplace.

You know what I'm sayin'?
Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party. Have some champagne.

You're makin' me feel like Ebenezer Scrooge.

Thanks a lot, Ms. Gennero. Do you think the baby can handle a little sip?

That baby's ready to tend bar.

Last chance.

Bye.
