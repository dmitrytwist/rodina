You don't like flyin', do you?

What gives you that idea?

You wanna know the secret to surviving air travel?

After you get where you're going, take off your shoes and your socks.
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes.

Fists with your toes?

I know, I know. It sounds crazy.
Trust me. I've been doin' it for nine years.

Yes, sir. Better than a shower and a hot cup of coffee.

Okay.

It's okay. I'm a cop.
Trust me. I've been doin' this for 11 years.

*voices in background*
On behalf of your captain and crew...

Have a very Merry Christmas.
